# README

This app will hopefully turn into a robust waitlist for EV chargers. This will be intended as a fast-paced, realtime app for fast chargers, and not so much for office-park style level-2 chargers.

More to come!

<!-- This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
